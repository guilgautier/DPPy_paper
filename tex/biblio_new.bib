abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are appealing models for subset selection prob-lems where diversity is desired. They offer surprisingly efficient inference, including sam-pling in O(N 3) time and O(N 2) space, where N is the number of base items. However, in some applications, N may grow so large that sampling from a DPP becomes compu-tationally infeasible. This is especially true in settings where the DPP kernel matrix can-not be represented by a linear decomposition of low-dimensional feature vectors. In these cases, we propose applying the Nystr{\"{o}}m ap-proximation to project the kernel matrix into a low-dimensional space. While theoretical guarantees for the Nystr{\"{o}}m approximation in terms of standard matrix norms have been previously established, we are concerned with probabilistic measures, like total variation dis-tance between the DPP and its Nystr{\"{o}}m ap-proximation, that behave quite differently. In this paper we derive new error bounds for the Nystr{\"{o}}m-approximated DPP and present em-pirical results to corroborate them. We then demonstrate the Nystr{\"{o}}m-approximated DPP by applying it to a motion capture summa-rization task.},

abstract = {Consider a finite weighted oriented graph. We study a probability measure on the set of spanning rooted oriented forests on the graph. We prove that the set of roots sampled from this measure is a determinantal process, characterized by a possibly non-symmetric kernel with complex eigenvalues. We then derive several results relating this measure to the Markov process associated with the starting graph, to the spectrum of its generator and to hitting times of subsets of the graph. In particular, the mean hitting time of the set of roots turns out to be independent of the starting point, conditioning or not to a given number of roots. Wilson's algorithm provides a way to sample this measure and, in absence of complex eigenvalues of the generator, we explain how to get samples with a number of roots approximating a prescribed integer. We also exploit the properties of this measure to give some probabilistic insight into the proof of an algebraic result due to Micchelli and Willoughby [13].

First, we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the linear statistics of a class of determinantal point processes, when the reference measure is a product measure supported on a hypercube, which satisfies the Nevai-class regularity condition, a result which may be of independent interest. Next, we introduce a Monte Carlo method based on these determinantal point processes, and prove a CLT with explicit limiting variance for the quadrature error, when the reference measure satisfies a stronger regularity condition. As a corollary, by taking a specific reference measure and using a construction similar to importance sampling, we obtain a general Monte Carlo method, which applies to any measure with continuously derivable density. Loosely speaking, our method can be interpreted as a stochastic counterpart to Gaussian quadrature, which, at the price of some convergence rate, is easily generalizable to any dimension and has a more explicit error term.},

Known as a de-terminantal point process (DPP), this distribution is widely used in machine learning to induce diversity in subset selection. In practice, we often wish to sample multiple subsets S with small expected size k = E[|S|] n from a very large matrix L, so it is important to minimize the pre-processing cost of the procedure (performed once) as well as the sampling cost (performed repeatedly). To that end, we propose a new algorithm which, given access to L, samples exactly from a DPP while satisfying the following two properties: (1) its preprocessing cost is n {\textperiodcentered} poly(k) (sublinear in the size of L) and (2) its sampling cost is poly(k) (independent of the size of L). Prior to this work, state-of-the-art exact samplers required O(n 3) preprocessing time and sampling time linear in n or dependent on L's spectrum.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have attracted substantial attention as an elegant probabilistic model that captures the balance between quality and diversity within sets. DPPs are conventionally parameterized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix, and this symmetric kernel encodes only repulsive interactions between items. These so-called symmetric DPPs have significant expressive power, and have been successfully applied to a variety of machine learning tasks, including recommendation systems, information retrieval, and automatic summarization, among many others. Efficient algorithms for learning symmetric DPPs and sampling from these models have been reasonably well studied. However, relatively little attention has been given to nonsymmetric DPPs, which relax the symmetric constraint on the kernel. Nonsymmetric DPPs allow for both repulsive and attractive item interactions, which can significantly improve modeling power, resulting in a model that may better fit for some applications. We present a method that enables a tractable algorithm, based on maximum likelihood estimation, for learning nonsymmetric DPPs from data composed of observed subsets. Our method imposes a particular decomposition of the nonsymmetric kernel that enables such tractable learning algorithms, which we analyze both theoretically and experimentally. We evaluate our model on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating improved predictive performance compared to symmetric DPPs, which have previously shown strong performance on modeling tasks associated with these datasets.},

Their applications in machine learning include summary extraction and recommendation systems. Yet, the cost of sampling from a DPP is prohibitive in large-scale applications, which has triggered an effort towards efficient approximate samplers. We build a novel MCMC sampler that combines ideas from combinatorial geometry, linear programming, and Monte Carlo methods to sample from DPPs with a fixed sample cardinality, also called projection DPPs. Our sampler leverages the ability of the hit-and-run MCMC kernel to efficiently move across convex bodies. Previous theoretical results yield a fast mixing time of our chain when targeting a distribution that is close to a projection DPP, but not a DPP in general. Our empirical results demonstrate that this extends to sampling projection DPPs, i.e., our sampler is more sample-efficient than previous approaches which in turn translates to faster convergence when dealing with costly-to-evaluate functions, such as summary extraction in our experiments.},

Most methods for this so-called "Bayesian optimization" only allow sequential exploration of the parameter space. However, it is often desirable to propose batches or sets of parameter values to explore simultaneously, especially when there are large parallel processing facilities at our disposal. Batch methods require modeling the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new approach for parallelizing Bayesian optimization by modeling the diversity of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs) whose kernels are learned automatically. This allows us to generalize a previous result as well as prove better regret bounds based on DPP sampling. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world robotics and hyper-parameter optimization tasks indicate that our DPP-based methods, especially those based on DPP sampling, outperform state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {We survey a number of models from physics, statistical mechanics, probability theory and combinatorics, which are each described in terms of an orthogonal polynomial ensemble. The most prominent example is apparently the Hermite ensemble, the eigenvalue distribution of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), and other well-known ensembles known in random matrix theory like the Laguerre ensemble for the spectrum of Wishart matrices. In recent years, a number of further interesting models were found to lead to orthogonal polynomial ensembles, among which the corner growth model, directed last passage percolation, the PNG droplet, non-colliding random processes, the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation, and others. Much attention has been paid to universal classes of asymptotic behaviors of these models in the limit of large particle numbers, in particular the spacings between the particles and the fluctuation behavior of the largest particle. Computer simulations suggest that the connections go even farther and also comprise the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The existing proofs require a substantial technical machinery and heavy tools from various parts of mathematics, in particular complex analysis, combinatorics and variational analysis. Particularly in the last decade, a number of fine results have been achieved, but it is obvious that a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the matter is still lacking. Hence, it seems an appropriate time to provide a surveying text on this research area.},

In contrast to traditional structured models like Markov random fields, which become intractable and hard to approximate in the presence of negative correlations, DPPs offer efficient and exact algorithms for sampling, marginalization, conditioning, and other inference tasks. We provide a gentle introduction to DPPs, focusing on the intuitions, algorithms, and extensions that are most relevant to the machine learning community, and show how DPPs can be applied to real-world applications like finding diverse sets of high-quality search results, building informative summaries by selecting diverse sentences from documents, modeling non-overlapping human poses in images or video, and automatically building timelines of important news stories.},

Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago.

abstract = {Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of repulsion and diversity over discrete sets of items. But their applicability to large sets is hindered by expensive cubic-complexity matrix operations for basic tasks such as sampling. In light of this, we propose a new method for approximate sampling from discrete {\$}k{\$}-DPPs. Our method takes advantage of the diversity property of subsets sampled from a DPP, and proceeds in two stages: first it constructs coresets for the ground set of items; thereafter, it efficiently samples subsets based on the constructed coresets. As opposed to previous approaches, our algorithm aims to minimize the total variation distance to the original distribution. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that our sampling algorithm works efficiently on large data sets, and yields more accurate samples than previous approaches.},

abstract = {In computer experiments setting, space-filling designs are used to produce inputs, viewed as point patterns. A first important property of the design is that the point pattern covers regularly the input space. A second property is the conservation of this regular covering if the point pattern is projected onto a lower dimensional space. According to the first requirement, it seems then natural to consider classes of spatial point process which generate repulsive patterns. The class of determinantal point processes (DPPs) is considered in this paper. In particular, we address the question: Can we construct a DPP such that any projection on a lower-dimensional space remains repulsive? We provide general conditions ensuring that the answer is positive and propose several examples. A new summary statistics built as a normalized version of the Ripley's function based on the sup norm is introduced to compare realizations of our examples as well as their projections in any dimension. We illustrate the interest of this research for Monte-Carlo integration: we show that the same initial spatial design, defined in {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}d{\$}, can be used to efficiently estimate integrals of {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}\backslashiota{\$}-valued for any {\$}\backslashiota=1,\backslashdots,d{\$}.},

abstract = {Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) were introduced by Macchi as a model for repulsive (fermionic) particle distributions. But their recent popularization is largely due to their usefulness for encouraging diversity in the final stage of a recommender system. The standard sampling scheme for finite DPPs is a spectral decomposition followed by an equivalent of a randomly diagonally-pivoted Cholesky factorization of an orthogonal projection, which is only applicable to Hermitian kernels and has an expensive setup cost. Researchers have begun to connect DPP sampling to {\$}LDL{\^{}}H{\$} factorizations as a means of avoiding the initial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformed the spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the number of kept modes is a small percentage of the ground set size. This article proves that trivial modifications of {\$}LU{\$} and {\$}LDL{\^{}}H{\$} factorizations yield efficient direct sampling schemes for non-Hermitian and Hermitian DPP kernels, respectively. Further, it is experimentally shown that even dynamically-scheduled, shared-memory parallelizations of high-performance dense and sparse-direct factorizations can be trivially modified to yield DPP sampling schemes with essentially identical performance.

abstract = {In this technical report, we discuss several sampling algorithms for Determinantal Point Processes (DPP). DPPs have recently gained a broad interest in the machine learning and statistics literature as random point processes with negative correlation, i.e., ones that can generate a "diverse" sample from a set of items. They are parametrized by a matrix {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}L{\}}{\$}, called {\$}L{\$}-ensemble, that encodes the correlations between items. The standard sampling algorithm is separated in three phases: 1/{\~{}}eigendecomposition of {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}L{\}}{\$}, 2/{\~{}}an eigenvector sampling phase where {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}L{\}}{\$}'s eigenvectors are sampled independently via a Bernoulli variable parametrized by their associated eigenvalue, 3/{\~{}}a Gram-Schmidt-type orthogonalisation procedure of the sampled eigenvectors. In a naive implementation, the computational cost of the third step is on average {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(N\backslashmu{\^{}}3){\$} where {\$}\backslashmu{\$} is the average number of samples of the DPP. We give an algorithm which runs in {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(N\backslashmu{\^{}}2){\$} and is extremely simple to implement. If memory is a constraint, we also describe a dual variant with reduced memory costs. In addition, we discuss implementation details often missing in the literature.},
