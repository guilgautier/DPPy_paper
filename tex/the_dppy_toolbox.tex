\section{The \DPPy\ toolbox} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_dppy_toolbox}

  \DPPy\ handles objects that fit the natural definition of the different DPPs models.
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item The \DPPy\ object corresponding to the finite $\DPP(\bfK)$ can be instantiated as
    \begin{nscenter}
      \texttt{FiniteDPP(%
        kernel\pyus type\pyeq\pystr{inclusion},\,%
        % projection\pyeq\pygreen{False},\,%
        \pykwargs\pylrcb{%
          \pystr{K}:K}%
        ).}
    \end{nscenter}
    It has two main sampling methods, namely \texttt{.sample\pyus exact()} and \texttt{.sample\pyus mcmc()}, implementing different variants of the exact sampling scheme and current state-of-the-art MCMC samplers.\\
    An additional \texttt{.sample\pyus exact\pyus k\pyus dpp()} allows to sample $k$-$\DPP$s \ie $\DPP$s conditionned to fixed cardinality samples $|\calX|=k$ \citep[Section 5]{KuTa12}.

		\item The \DPPy\ object associated to, \eg the Laguerre $\beta$-ensemble can be instantiated as
    \begin{nscenter}
      \texttt{LaguerreEnsemble(%
         beta\pyeq\pygreen{3.14}%
         )}.
    \end{nscenter}
    It can be sampled using either the full matrix model (eigenvalues of random covariance matrix) when $\beta\in\lrcb{1,2,4}$ or the tridiagonal one for $\beta > 0$,
    \begin{nscenter}
      \texttt{.sample\pyus banded\pyus model(%
          shape\pyeq\pygreen{1.0},\,%
          scale\pyeq\pygreen{2.0},\,%
          size\pyeq\pygreen{50}%
        )}
    \end{nscenter}
    Displays are available via \texttt{.plot()} to plot the last realization and \texttt{.hist()} to construct the empirical distribution that converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur distribution.
  \end{itemize}
  More information can be found in the documentation\footnoteref{fn:docs} and the corresponding Jupyter \href{https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy/tree/master/notebooks}{\textcolor{magenta}{notebooks}}, which showcase \DPPy\ objects.
